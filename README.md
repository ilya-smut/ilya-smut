  <h3> Cyber Security student from Leicester </h3>
  👋 Hi there, I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for secure coding, cryptography and penetration testing. 🕵️‍♂️💻

I'm currently studying BSc (Hons) in Cyber Security at De Montfort University, with a focus on Secure Scripting, Business Applications, Industrial Cryptography, and Incident Response and Cyber Threat Intelligence. 🎓🔐

Outside of class, I love to get my hands dirty with Python, Java, and C++, and I'm a big fan of Linux. I'm also working on my CCNA certification, so I spend a lot of time tinkering with network configurations in Cisco Packet Tracer. 🖥️🔧

But it's not all tech all the time for me. I'm multilingual, speaking English, Russian, and Belarusian fluently. I'm also a bit of a history buff and I believe strongly in equal access to education for everyone. 🌍📚

You'll find me working on a range of projects here, from cryptography to discord bots to helper utils and dictionaries. Always learning, always growing. 🌱🚀
